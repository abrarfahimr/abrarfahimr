### Hi! The name is Abrar 👋

Web developer with a background in design and focus on full stack development. Developing interactive, user-friendly, and scalable digital experience. I excel in working on cross-functional teams ensuring high-quality output and efficient performance.

- 🔭 Graduated from BrainStation September 2022.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python 🐍.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any project small to large.
- 🤔 I’m looking for fullstack software development jobs. Remote in Canada, or onsite in Toronto.
- 💬 Ask me about: design, webdev, latest tech news, video games.
- 📫 How to reach me: linkedin.com/in/abrarfahimr/
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was born in a generation in love with video gaming so this is a no-brainer. But some of my favourite games are Dota 2, Monster Hunter World, and the Dark Souls series. Anime is my only source of entertainment besides youtube. I rarely see any shows on Netflix unless it's about mythological fiction like The Witcher and Lord of The Rings. I am a sucker for romance-comedy series.
