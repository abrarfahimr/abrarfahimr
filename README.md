- âš¡ Fun fact: I was born in a generation in love with video gaming so this is a no-brainer. But some of my favourite games are Dota 2, Monster Hunter World, and the Dark Souls series. Anime is my only source of entertainment besides youtube. I rarely see any shows on Netflix unless it's about mythological fiction like The Witcher and Lord of The Rings. I am a sucker for romance-comedy series.
