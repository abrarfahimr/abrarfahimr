### Hi! The name is Abrar ðŸ‘‹

Web developer with a background in design and focus on full stack development. Developing interactive, user-friendly, and scalable digital experience. I excel in working on cross-functional teams ensuring high-quality output and efficient performance.

- ðŸ”­ Graduated from BrainStation September 2022.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning typescript.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project small to large.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for fullstack software development jobs. Remote in Canada, or onsite in Toronto.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: design, webdev, latest tech news, video games.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: linkedin.com/in/abrarfahimr/
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I was born in a generation in love with video gaming so this is a no-brainer. But some of my favourite games are Dota 2, Monster Hunter World, and the Dark Souls series. Anime is my only source of entertainment besides youtube. I rarely see any shows on Netflix unless it's about mythological fiction like The Witcher and Lord of The Rings. I am a sucker for romance-comedy series.
