### Hi! The name is Abrar 👋

Web developer with a background in design and focus on full stack development. Developing interactive, user-friendly, and scalable digital experience. I excel in working on cross-functional teams ensuring high-quality output and efficient performance.

My Principles:

Work to be useful: One of my favourite quotes from the book “Meditation” by Marcus Aurelius is “To be useful to others is natural. Then don’t object to what is useful to you-being of use.” A product was built primarily to be of use to people. I implement this to my design in every step so that I am constantly thinking about how might I make this more useful to my users. I also implement this idea in my work ethic as I try to find ways to be useful to my seniors and juniors alike.

Collaborate, Learn, rinse and repeat, achieve success:
The book Lean UX by Jeff Gothelf and Josh Seiden taught me how valuable cross-functional collaboration is to bring a shared idea of the product experience that can drastically improve the productivity of the team. There is more to success than just an increase in sales or performance metrics. To me, success should also be measured in terms of meeting the team goals because it directly affects the performance of the company.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I was born in a generation in love with video gaming so this is a no-brainer. But some of my favourite games are Dota 2, Monster Hunter World, and the Dark Souls series. Anime is my only source of entertainment besides youtube. I rarely see any shows on Netflix unless it's about mythological fiction like The Witcher and Lord of The Rings. I am a sucker for romance-comedy series.
